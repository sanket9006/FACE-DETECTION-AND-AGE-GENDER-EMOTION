Project on Face Detection and Detecting Age ,Gender ,Emotion on Faces

**Problem Statement: -**

**Face Recognition – Identify the Age, Emotion & Ethnicity of a person**
(Category: -Computer Vision)
**1) Background: -**

The father of facial recognition was Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe. Working
in the 1960s, Bledsoe developed a system that could classify photos of faces by hand
using what’s known as a RAND tablet, a device that people could use to input
horizontal and vertical coordinates on a grid using a stylus that emitted electromagnetic
pulses. Bledsoe developed the first semi-automatic face recognition system under
contract to the US Government.

Facial recognition made bold head Bledsoe developed lines in early 2001 immediately
after it was first used in a public space—at Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa—by the law
enforcement authorities to search for criminals and terrorists among the crowd of
thousands of spectators.

Facial recognition is a growing part of our everyday lives through devices and
applications. Facial recognition is a biometric method of identifying a person based on
a photograph of their face. Facial recognition technology falls under the category of
biometrics, or the measurement of biological data.

It is a system is a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a
person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source

**2) Your Understanding: -**

Face recognition is one of the many wonders that AI research has brought
forward to the world. Facial recognition technology falls under the category of
biometrics, or the measurement of biological data. Facial recognition technology can
be used in a number of other places, such as airports, government buildings, and ATMs
(automatic teller machines), and to secure computers and mobile phones.
Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person
using their face. It captures, analyse and compares patterns based on the person's facial
details.

i. The Face Recognition process is an essential step as it detects human faces and
Recognize people in images and videos which is helpful in preventing crime
protecting events and making air travel more convenient etc.

ii. Design a project (program) which will accept input from user and provide Age,
Gender, Ethnicity, Emotion of Faces which are present Image

iii. Program transforms face into a set of digital information (data) based on the
person's facial features.

iv. Then on this face perform suitable algorithm (technique) for Identification of
person Age, Gender and Ethnicity.
 Detailed Algorithm is Explained below.
 
**3) Scope: -**

This project involves building project (program) implemented using Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning for Human Face Recognition, Identifying age,
Ethnicity of Person and Gender.

My project will give Information regarding Age, Gender, Emotion, Ethnicity of
person using his face in the form of Image in which around his face all this detail will
be mentioned and it will (project) also give output in the form of text.
My project is using use Haar Cascades (xml files) for detection of face, this Haar
Cascade file is (result of) prepared using Huge dataset which consist of Positive and
Negative images
